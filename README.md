## Datawrapper Chart
I made a datawrapper chart on based on the Flying Etiquette data provided by FiveThirtyEight. I chose the survey question: "On a 6 hour flight from NYC to LA, how many times is it acceptable to get up if you're not in an aisle seat?" as I want to know the most acceptable number of times for non-aisle seat passengers to get up on a 6-Hour flight from NYC to LA. It is interesting to find that out of the 855 survey respondents, the majority can accept up to two to three times. In addition, there are around 11% of the respondents (91 respondents) can accept gettinng up more than five times. Only about 1.5% of the respondents (13 respondents) think that it's not okay to get up.
