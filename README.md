## Datawrapper Chart
*I made a datawrapper chart on based on the Flying Etiquette data provided by FiveThirtyEight.*
I chose the survey question: **"On a 6 hour flight from NYC to LA, how many times is it acceptable to get up if you're not in an aisle seat?"** as I want to know the most acceptable number of times for non-aisle seat passengers to get up on a 6-Hour flight from NYC to LA. 
- It is interesting to find that out of the **855** survey respondents, the **majority** can accept up to <ins>two to three times</ins>.
- In addition, there are around **11%** of the respondents (91 respondents) can accept gettinng up <ins>more than five times</ins>.
- Only about **1.5%** of the respondents (13 respondents) think that <ins>it's not okay to get up</ins>.
